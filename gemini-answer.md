# Project Idea: "Reddit on this Day" Story Generator

This project creates a personalized "Timehop" or "On This Day" experience for a user's Reddit history. It will fetch the user's posts, comments, and saved items from the same date in previous years and present them in an engaging "story" format.

## Features:

*   **User Authentication:** Securely connect to a user's Reddit account using OAuth2.
*   **Personalized Content:** Fetches a user's own posts, comments, and saved items from the current date in previous years.
*   **"Story" Presentation:** Displays the retrieved content in a visually appealing, full-screen, tappable story format, similar to Instagram or Snapchat Stories. Each post, comment, or saved item would be a separate "card" in the story.
*   **Content Details:** Each card in the story would show the content of the post or comment, the subreddit it was in, the score it received, and a link to the original item.
*   **Date Navigation:** Allows the user to jump to different dates to see their Reddit history for that day.
*   **Sharing:** A feature to generate a shareable image or link of a particularly interesting memory.

## API Endpoints to be Used:

*   **/api/v1/me**: To get the currently authenticated user's profile information.
*   **/user/username/submitted**: To retrieve the user's submitted posts.
*   **/user/username/comments**: To retrieve the user's comments.
*   **/user/username/saved**: To retrieve the user's saved posts.

The application will need to iterate through the results from these endpoints and filter them by the desired date (e.g., July 26th, 2022, July 26th, 2021, etc.).

## Potential Implementation Plan:

*   **Frontend:** A web-based interface built with a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to create the interactive story component.
*   **Backend:** A Python server using a framework like FastAPI or Flask to handle:
    *   The OAuth2 authentication flow with Reddit.
    *   Making requests to the Reddit API to fetch user data.
    *   Processing and filtering the data to find items from the correct dates.
    *   Serving the data to the frontend in a structured format.
*   **Styling:** CSS with a library like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to create a clean and modern look for the story interface.
*   **Deployment:** The application could be deployed on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku.

This project is a great way to build a full-stack application that interacts with a popular API and provides a fun, personalized experience for users.
